A Workflow for Rapid Unbiased Quantification of Fibrillar Feature Alignment in Biological Images
https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.22.453401v1

Algorithms to calculate fibre alignment from biological images can be found in this repository. Implementations in Python and MATLAB can be found in the specified folders. Documentation for running each version is included in the folders as well. 

This work builds upon and fleshes out previous workflows introduced in: [Aratyn-Schaus et al. Mol Biol Cell 2011; 22(8):1330-1339](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21307339) and [Cetera et al. Nat Commun 2014; 5:1-12](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25413675)
